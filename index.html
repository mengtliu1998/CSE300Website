							<p style="font-family: georgia;font-size: 18px;font-style: bold">About Me</p>
								<p> Hi, My name is Meng Ting Liu and I am currently a junior studying computer science at Stony Brook University. I was born in Fujian (a province in China), immigrated here when I was in elementary school, and am currently living in Brooklyn, New York with my parents and two younger brothers. </p>

								<p>During my senior year in high school, I saw a close friend of mine create a simple mini game from scratch and I decided that I also want to be able create things like that. So I decided to give computer science a try in college.</p>

								<p></p>
								<p></p>

							<p style="font-family: georgia;font-size: 18px;font-style: bold">Experiences</p>

								<p>One of my first experiences with coding was in my Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming class. What stood out to me and furthered my interest in computer science was our final project in that class. We had to create a Connect Four type of game in Eclipse, and I struggled. A lot. There were a lot of bugs and I was overwhelmed. But when I was finally able to debug my codes and make it work, I was amazed, amazed at the fact that I was able to create something out of what seemed to be nothing. The feelings I felt when my program finally worked made all of my struggles worth it. Every time I wanted to pull my hair out not knowing how to fix a bug. Every time I spent hours trying to fix something only to accidentally make it worse. All of that frustration melted away when I saw my codes running perfectly and smoothly.</p>

								<p>Most of my work experiences involves tutoring kids in math and Engulish or customer services. I have attended a hackathon (Hack@CEWIT 2019) where my team and I created a translation app based on an image. The interface is similar to a camera which allows the user to aim it at an object, tap on the object displayed on the screen, and the screen would display the name of the object in two languages selected by the user. </p>
